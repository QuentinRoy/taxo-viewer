abstract = {This article introduces the Complexity of Interaction Sequences model (CIS). CIS describes the structure of interaction techniques and the SimCIS simulator uses these descriptions to predict their performance in the context of an interaction sequence. The model defines the complexity of an interaction technique as a measure of its effectiveness within a given context. We tested CIS to compare three interaction techniques: fixed unimanual palettes, fixed bimanual palettes and toolglasses. The model predicts that the complexity of both palettes depends on interaction sequences, while toolglasses are less context-dependent. CIS also predicts that fixed bimanual palettes outperform the other two techniques. Predictions were tested empirically with a controlled experiment and confirmed the hypotheses. We argue that, in order to be generalizable, experimental comparisons of interaction techniques should include the concept of context sensitivity. CIS is a step in this direction as it helps predict the performance of interaction techniques according to the context of use.},

abstract = {We present Mockup Builder, a semi-immersive environment for conceptual design which allows virtual mockups to be created using gestures. Our goal is to provide familiar ways for people to conceive, create and manipulate three-dimensional shapes. To this end, we developed on-and-above-the-surface interaction techniques based on asymmetric bimanual interaction for creating and editing 3D models in a stereoscopic environment. Our approach combines both hand and finger tracking in the space on and above a multi-touch surface. This combination brings forth an alternative design environment where users can seamlessly switch between interacting on the surface or above it to leverage the benefit of both interaction spaces. A formal user evaluation conducted with experienced users shows very promising avenues for further work towards providing an alternative to current user interfaces for modeling. },

Another issue is how to effectively test gestures to ensure that they are not unintentionally activated by a user's normal movements during everyday usage.

Les Wave menus am{\'{e}}liorent le mode novice des Marking menus en favorisant la navigation dans la hi{\'{e}}rarchie de commandes. En consid{\'{e}}rant la courbure des gestes de l'utilisateur, les Flower menus augmentent le nombre de commandes disponibles et am{\'{e}}liorent l'apprentissage du mode expert des Marking menus. Les Leaf Menus sont quant {\`{a}} eux des menus lin{\'{e}}aires enrichis de raccourcis gestuels et con{\c{c}}us pour {\^{e}}tre utilis{\'{e}}s sur des dispositifs mobiles. Enfin, les Multi-Touch Menus exploitent la technologie multi-points des surfaces tactiles afin de naviguer et s{\'{e}}lectionner des commandes avec les cinq doigts de la main.},

abstract = {This paper presents Flower menu, a new type of Marking menu that does not only support straight, but also curved gestures for any of the 8 usual orientations. Flower menus make it possible to put many commands at each menu level and thus to create as large a hierarchy as needed for common applications. Indeed our informal analysis of menu breadth in popular applications shows that a quarter of them have more than 16 items. Flower menus can easily contain 20 items and even more (theoretical maximum of 56 items). Flower menus also support within groups as well as hierarchical groups. They can thus favor breadth organization (within groups) or depth organization (hierarchical groups): as a result, the designers can lay out items in a very flexible way in order to reveal meaningful item groupings. We also investigate the learning performance of the expert mode of Flower menus. A user experiment is presented that compares linear menus (baseline condition), Flower menus and Polygon menus, a variant of Marking menus that supports a breadth of 16 items. Our experiment shows that Flower menus are more efficient than both Polygon and Linear menus for memorizing command activation in expert mode.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is to provide users immersed in a multi-platform environment with the possibility of interacting with an application while freely moving from one device to another. We describe the solution that we have developed for a service to support platform-aware runtime migration for Web applications. This allows users interacting with an application to change device and continue their interaction from the same point. The service performs the migration of the application taking into account its runtime state and adapting the application interface to the features of the target platforms. The service is optimized for applications developed through a model-based, multiple-level approach. The intelligence of the adaptive interfaces resides in the migration server, which adapts data collected at runtime from their original format to the format best fitting the features of the target platform. We also indicate how it is possible to extend this result in order to support partial migration and synergistic access, by which a part of the user interface is kept on one device during runtime and the remaining part is moved to another with different characteristics.},

In this paper we present a logical framework and some fundamental concepts and dimensions that can be useful to help user interface designers and developers understand migratory interfaces, analyse the state of the art, and identify areas which need further research. A number of works in this area are compared and referred to such framework and dimensions, so as to identify the advantages and drawbacks of the various approaches.},

@article{Bhavnani2000,
abstract = {Several studies show that despite experience, many users with basic command knowledge do not progress to an efficient use of complex computer applications. These studies suggest that knowledge of tasks and knowledge of tools are insufficient to lead users to become efficient. To address this problem, we argue that users also need to learn strategies in the intermediate layers of knowledge lying between tasks and tools. These strategies are (a) efficient because they exploit specific powers of computers, (b) difficult to acquire because they are suggested by neither tasks nor tools, and (c) general in nature having wide applicability. The above characteristics are first demonstrated in the context of aggregation strategies that exploit the iterative power of computers. A cognitive analysis of a real-world task reveals that even though such aggregation strategies can have large effects on task time, errors, and on the quality of the final product, they are not often used by even experienced users. We identify other strategies beyond aggregation that can be efficient and useful across computer applications and show how they were used to develop a new approach to training with promising results. We conclude by suggesting that a systematic analysis of strategies in the intermediate layers of knowledge can lead not only to more effective ways to design training but also to more principled approaches to design systems. These advances should lead users to make more efficient use of complex computer systems.},

Reaction time was an increasing linear function of the average amount of information transmitted. The self-paced and discrete tasks gave very similar results. The findings are interpreted as indicating the importance of overlearning in determining S-R compatibility effects. Also, S's familiarity in dealing with specific subsets drawn from familiar alphabets may affect his information-handling rates when restricted subsets of stimuli and responses are used.

@article{Buchholz1992,
abstract = {A kinematic model has been developed for simulation and prediction of the prehensile capabilities of the human hand. The kinematic skeleton of the hand is characterized by ideal joints and simple segments. Finger-joint angulation is characterized by yaw (abduction-adduction), pitch (flexion-extension) and roll (axial rotation) angles. The model is based on an algorithm that determines contact between two ellipsoids, which are used to approximate the geometry of the cutaneous surface of the hand segments. The model predicts the hand posture (joint angles) for power grasp of ellipsoidal objects by 'wrapping' the fingers around the object. Algorithms for two grip types are included: (1) a transverse volar grasp, which has the thumb abducted for added power; and (2) a diagonal volar grasp, which has the thumb adducted for an element of precision. Coefficients for estimating anthropometric parameters from hand length and breadth are incorporated in the model. Graphics procedures are included for visual display of the model. In an effort to validate the predictive capabilities of the model, joint angles were measured on six subjects grasping circular cylinders of various diameters and these measured joint angles were compared with angles predicted by the model. Sensitivity of the model to the various input parameters was also determined. On an average, the model predicted joint flexion angles that were 5.3{\%} or 2.8 degrees +/- 12.2 degrees larger than the measured angles. Good agreement was found for the MCP and PIP joints, but results for DIP were more variable because of its dependence on the predictions for the proximal joints.},

abstract = {Interacting with mobile devices using touch can lead to fingers occluding valuable screen real estate. For the smallest devices, the idea of using a touch-enabled display is almost wholly impractical. In this paper we investigate sensing user touch around small screens like these. We describe a prototype device with infra-red (IR) proximity sensors embedded along each side and capable of detecting the presence and position of fingers in the adjacent regions. When this device is rested on a flat surface, such as a table or desk, the user can carry out single and multi-touch gestures using the space around the device. This gives a larger input space than would otherwise be possible which may be used in conjunction with or instead of on-display touch input. Following a detailed description of our prototype, we discuss some of the interactions it affords.},

But as with "multimedia," the details are about as clear as the early morning fog. Models of use tend to be appliance-centric, focussing either on the television (home shopping and video-on-demand) or personal computer (Internet). Few if any can tell a coherent and unifying story even at this course level of analysis. Clearly, changes are coming, and to reap the potential benefits, the level of discourse must be raised significantly. The prime objective of this presentation is to contribute to laying the foundation for such a discourse. We introduce a new human-centric model with which future technologies can be characterized. The model presents a unified framework for looking at human-computer as well as technology mediated human-human interaction. A prime property of the model is the consideration it gives to both foreground and background interactions.},

In this paper we review the existing literature on one type of wearable -- smartwatches -- and extend their definition, in addition to highlighting the need to understand users' everyday appropriation of these technologies. We present initial findings from an on going interview study with ten early adopters that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate why and how people use smartwatches in real life. We describe everyday use of smartwatches, highlight the added value seen by users, and identify the limitations to mass adoption as expressed by current users.},

Based on the devices' spatial configurations, Duet coordinates their motion and touch input, and extends their visual and tactile output to one another. This transforms the watch into an active element that enhances a wide range of phone-based interactive tasks, and enables a new class of multi-device gestures and sensing techniques. A technical evaluation shows the accuracy of these gestures and sensing techniques, and a subjective study on Duet provides insights, observations, and guidance for future work.},

Weave allows developers to focus on their target interaction behaviors and manipulate devices regarding their capabilities and affordances, rather than low-level specifications. Weave also contributes an integrated authoring environment for developers to program and test cross-device behaviors, and when ready, deploy these behaviors to its runtime environment on users' ad-hoc network of devices. An evaluation of Weave with 12 participants on a range of tasks revealed that Weave significantly reduced the effort of developers for creating and iterating on cross-device interaction.},

abstract = {Menus are a primary control in current interfaces, but there has been relatively little theoretical work to model their performance. We propose a model of menu performance that goes beyond previous work by incorporating components for Fitts' Law pointing time, visual search time when novice, Hick-Hyman Law decision time when expert, and for the transition from novice to expert behaviour. The model is able to predict performance for many different menu designs, including adaptive split menus, items with different frequencies and sizes, and multi-level menus. We tested the model by comparing predictions for four menu designs (traditional menus, recency and frequency based split menus, and an adaptive 'morphing' design) with empirical measures. The empirical data matched the predictions extremely well, suggesting that the model can be used to explore a wide range of menu possibilities before implementation.},

abstract = {Research in multi-touch interaction has typically been focused on direct spatial manipulation; techniques have been create to result in the most intuitive mapping between the movement of the hand and the resultant change in the virtual object. However, as we attempt to design for more complex operations, the expectation of spatial manipulation becomes infeasible. We introduce Multi-tap Sliders for operation in what we call abstract parametric spaces that do not have an obvious literal spatial representation, such as exposure, brightness, contrast and saturation for image editing. This new widget design promotes multi-touch interaction for prolonged use in scenarios that require adjustment of multiple parameters as part of an operation. The multi-tap sliders encourage the user to keep her visual focus on the target, instead of the requiring to look back at the interface. Our research emphasizes ergonomics, clear visual design, and fluid transition between the selection of parameters and their subsequent adjustment for a given operation. We demonstrate a new technique for quickly selecting and adjusting multiple numerical parameters. A preliminary user study points out improvements over the traditional sliders.},

This success has come despite the fact that games were separated at birth from most of the accepted paradigms for designing usable interactive software. It is now apparent that this separate and less-constrained environment has allowed for much design creativity and many innovations that make game interfaces highly usable. We analyzed several current game interfaces looking for ideas that could be applied more widely to general UIs. In this paper we present four of these: effortless community, learning by watching, deep customizability, and fluid system-human interaction. These ideas have arisen in games because of their focus on user performance and user satisfaction, and we believe that they can help to improve the usability of other types of applications.},

@misc{Ferscha2007,
abstract = {Pervasive computing has postulated to invisibly integrate technology into everyday objects in such a way, that these objects turn into smart things. Not only a single object of this kind is supposed to represent the interface among the "physical world" of atoms and the "digital world" of bits, but a whole landscapes of them. The interaction with such technology rich artefacts is supposed to be guided by their affordance, i.e. the ability of an artefact to express the modality of its appropriate use. We study human gesticulation and the manipulation of graspable and movable everyday artefacts as a potentially effective means for the interaction with smart things. In this work we consider gestures in the general sense of a movement or a state (posture) of the human body, as well as a movement or state of any physical object resulting from human manipulation. Intuitive "everyday"-gestures have been collected in a series of user tests, yielding a catalogue of generic body and artefact gesture dynamics. Atomic gestures are described by trajectories of orientation data, while composite gestures are defined by a compositional gesture grammar. The respective mechanisms for the recognition of such gestures have been implemented in a general software framework supported by an accelerometer-based sensing system. Showcases involving multiple gesture sensors demonstrate the viability of implicit embedded interaction for real life scenarios.},

In particular, we examine the consequences of wearability on output strategies. Two major points are investigated: (1) since wearable devices are usually personal and worn on the user, it becomes harder to share the device with other people, making single device collaborative interaction harder; (2) the smaller size of wearable devices narrows the bandwidth and options for feedback. Implications from these major changes are also discussed in the context of Lundgren’s et al framework [5].},

abstract = {In almost all computer applications, users must enter correct words for the desired objects or actions. For success without extensive training, or in first-tries for new targets, the system must recognize terms that will be chosen spontaneously. We studied spontaneous word choice for objects in five application-related domains, and found the variability to be surprisingly large. In every case two people favored the same term with probability <0.20. Simulations show how this fundamental property of language limits the success of various design methodologies for vocabulary-driven interaction. For example, the popular approach in which access is via one designer's favorite single word will result in SO-90 percent failure rates in many common situations. An optimal strategy, unlimited aliasing, is derived and shown to be capable of several-fold improvements.},

@article{gajos_automatically_2010,
abstract = {Today's computer-human interfaces are typically designed with the assumption that they are going to be used by an able-bodied person, who is using a typical set of input and output devices, who has typical perceptual and cognitive abilities, and who is sitting in a stable, warm environment. Any deviation from these assumptions may drastically hamper the person's effectiveness-not because of any inherent barrier to interaction, but because of a mismatch between the person's effective abilities and the assumptions underlying the interface design. We argue that automatic personalized interface generation is a feasible and scalable solution to this challenge. We present our Supple system, which can automatically generate interfaces adapted to a person's devices, tasks, preferences, and abilities. In this paper we formally define interface generation as an optimization problem and demonstrate that, despite a large solution space (of up to 10{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}1{\{}$\backslash$textasciicircum{\}}7 possible interfaces), the problem is computationally feasible. In fact, for a particular class of cost functions, Supple produces exact solutions in under a second for most cases, and in a little over a minute in the worst case encountered, thus enabling run-time generation of user interfaces. We further show how several different design criteria can be expressed in the cost function, enabling different kinds of personalization. We also demonstrate how this approach enables extensive user- and system-initiated run-time adaptations to the interfaces after they have been generated. Supple is not intended to replace human user interface designers-instead, it offers alternative user interfaces for those people whose devices, tasks, preferences, and abilities are not sufficiently addressed by the hand-crafted designs. Indeed, the results of our study show that, compared to manufacturers' defaults, interfaces automatically generated by Supple significantly improve speed, accuracy and satisfaction of people with motor impairments.},

In this paper, we present an alternative approach: SUPPLE++ automatically generates interfaces which are tailored to an individual's motor capabilities and can be easily adjusted to accommodate varying vision capabilities. SUPPLE++ models users. motor capabilities based on a onetime motor performance test and uses this model in an optimization process, generating a personalized interface. A preliminary study indicates that while there is still room for improvement, SUPPLE++ allowed one user to complete tasks that she could not perform using a standard interface, while for the remaining users it resulted in an average time savings of 20{\%}, ranging from an slowdown of 3{\%} to a speedup of 43{\%}.},

abstract = {In order to give people ubiquitous access to software applications, device controllers, and Internet services, it will be necessary to automatically adapt user interfaces to the computational devices at hand (eg, cell phones, PDAs, touch panels, etc.). While previous researchers have proposed solutions to this problem, each has limitations. This paper proposes a novel solution based on treating interface adaptation as an optimization problem. When asked to render an interface on a specific device, our supple system searches for the rendition that meets the device's constraints and minimizes the estimated effort for the user's expected interface actions. We make several contributions: 1) precisely defining the interface rendition problem, 2) demonstrating how user traces can be used to customize interface rendering to particular user's usage pattern, 3) presenting an efficient interface rendering algorithm, 4) performing experiments that demonstrate the utility of our approach.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous environments call for innovative uses of existing applications. In this paper we present our solution for partial Web migration: it allows users to interactively select parts of existing interfaces and have them migrate to a target device. The underlying supporting platform exploits logical user interface descriptions and a set of transformations. This environment is particularly useful for supporting mobile users accessing complex Web applications, such as various emerging mash-ups. We also show an example of use of our solution in a widespread Web application, and report on a user test.},

Using a scenario-based approach, we identify the requirements for this type of applications. We then introduce Substance, a data-oriented framework that decouples functionality from data, and Shared Substance, a middleware implemented in Substance that provides powerful sharing abstractions. We describe our implementation of two applications with Shared Substance and discuss the insights gained from these experiments. Our finding is that the combination of a data-oriented programming model with middleware support for sharing data and functionality provides a flexible, robust solution with low viscosity at both design-time and run-time.},

abstract = {Can discrete, single-shot movements and continuous, cyclical movements be reduced to a single concept? In the classical, computational approach to human motor behaviour, cyclical aimed movement has generally been considered to derive from discrete primitives through a concatenation mechanism. Much importance, accordingly, has been attached to discrete-movement paradigms and to techniques allowing the segmentation of continuous data. An alternative approach, suggested by the nonlinear dynamical systems theory, views discreteness as a limiting case of cyclicity. Although attempts have been made recently to account for discrete movements in dynamical terms, cyclical paradigms have been favoured. The concatenation interpretation of cyclical aimed movement is criticized on the ground that it implies a complete waste of mechanical energy once in every half-cycle. Some kinematic data from a one-dimensional reciprocal (i.e., cyclical) aiming experiment are reported, suggesting that human subjects do save mascular efforts from one movement to the next in upper-limb cyclical aiming. The experiment demonstrated convergence on simple harmonic motion as aiming tolerance was increased, an outcome interpreted with reference to Hooke's law, in terms of the muscles' capability of storing potential, elastic energy across movement reversals. Not only is the concatenation concept problematic for understanding cyclical aimed movements, but the very reality of discrete movements is questionable too. It is pointed out that discrete motor acts of real life are composed of complete cycles, rather than half-cycles.},

They argue that toolglass advantage over standard technique comes from merging selection and manipulation and not from 2 handedness.
I'm not convince by their arguments.

abstract = {To determine whether other digits move when normal humans attempt to move just one digit, we asked 10 right-handed subjects to move one finger at a time while we recorded the motion of all five digits simultaneously with both a video motion analysis system and an instrumented glove. We quantified the independence of the digits to compare (1) the different digits, (2) the right versus the left hand, and (3) movements at a self-paced frequency versus externally paced movements at 3 Hz. We also quantified the degree to which motion occurred at the proximal, middle, or distal joint of each digit. Even when asked to move just one finger, normal human subjects produced motion in other digits. Movements of the thumb, index finger, and little finger typically were more highly individuated than were movements of the middle or ring fingers. Fingers of the dominant hand were not more independent than were those of the nondominant hand. Self-paced movements made at {\~{}}2 Hz were more highly individuated than were externally paced movements at 3 Hz. Angular motion tended to be greatest at the middle joint of each digit, with increased angular motion at the proximal and distal joints during 3 Hz movements. Simultaneous motion of noninstructed digits may result in part from passive mechanical connections between the digits, in part from the organization of multitendoned finger muscles, and in part from distributed neural control of the hand.

We explore and evaluate techniques that use a non-preferred-hand button or touchpad to phrase together one or more independent pen strokes into a unitary multi-stroke gesture. We then illustrate how such phrasing techniques can support multiple-stroke selection gestures with tapping, crossing, lassoing, disjoint selection, circles of exclusion, selection decorations, and implicit grouping operations. These capabilities extend the expressiveness of pen gesture interfaces and suggest new directions for multiple-stroke pen input techniques.},

abstract = {Building on Buxton's foreground/background model, we discuss the importance of explicitly considering both foreground interaction and background interaction, as well as transitions between foreground and background, in the design and implementation of sensing techniques for sensor-enhanced mobile devices. Our view is that the foreground concerns deliberate user activity where the user is attending to the device, while the background is the realm of inattention or split attention, using naturally occurring user activity as an input that allows the device to infer or anticipate user needs. The five questions for sensing systems of Bellotti et al. [2002] proposed as a framework for this special issue, primarily address the foreground, but neglect critical issues with background sensing. To support our perspective, we discuss a variety of foreground and background sensing techniques that we have implemented for sensor-enhanced mobile devices, such as powering on the device when the user picks it up, sensing when the user is holding the device to his ear, automatically switching between portrait and landscape display orientations depending on how the user is holding the device, and scrolling the display using tilt. We also contribute system architecture issues, such as using the foreground/background model to handle cross-talk between multiple sensor-based interaction techniques, and theoretical perspectives, such as a classification of recognition errors based on explicitly considering transitions between the foreground and background. Based on our experiences, we propose design issues and lessons learned for foreground/background sensing systems.},

abstract = {Stitching is a new interaction technique that allows users to combine pen-operated mobile devices with wireless networking by using pen gestures that span multiple displays. To stitch, a user starts moving the pen on one screen, crosses over the bezel, and finishes the stroke on the screen of a nearby device. Properties of each portion of the pen stroke are observed by the participating devices, synchronized via wireless network communication, and recognized as a unitary act performed by one user, thus binding together the devices. We identify the general requirements of stitching and describe a prototype photo sharing application that uses stitching to allow users to copy images from one tablet to another that is nearby, expand an image across multiple screens, establish a persistent shared workspace, or use one tablet to present images that a user selects from another tablet. We also discuss design issues that arise from proxemics, that is, the sociological implications of users collaborating in close quarters.},

This calls for new research from various domains on group binding methods for wearable devices.},

While some of the users have positive attitudes towards these new products, some users may reject to use them due to different reasons. User experience is subjective, and effected by various parameters. Among these the first impression, namely the perceived qualities has an important impact on product acceptance. This paper aims to explore the perceived qualities of wearables and define the relations between them. An empirical study is conducted, to find out the hierarchy and meaningful relationships between the perceived qualities of smart wearables. The study is based on personal construct theory and data is presented by Cross-Impact Analysis. The patterns behind affection and affected qualities are explored to understand the design requirements for the best integration of wearables into daily lives.},

A pen is often used in many fields because it is easy to use and familiar. On the other hand, however, it is a quite inconvenient because the information printed on paper is static. If digital features are added to this paper environment, the users can do their work more easily and efficiently. AR (augmented reality) Lamp is a stand-type projector and camera embedded system with the form factor of a desk lamp. Its users can modify the virtually augmented content on top of the paper with seamlessly combined virtual and physical worlds. AR is quite appealing, but it is difficult to popularize due to the lack of interaction. In this paper, the interaction methods that people can use easily and intuitively are focused on. A high-fidelity prototype of the system is presented, and a set of novel interactions is demonstrated. A pilot evaluation of the system is also reported to explore its usage possibility.},

The Gesture Watch utilizes an array of infrared proximity sensors to sense hand gestures made over the device and interprets the gestures using hidden Markov models. The Gesture Watch maps intuitive gross hand gestures to control signals such as the play and pause commands commonly found on mobile media players. We present our evaluation of the Gesture Watch designed to determine its the accuracy and usability. In our study, 10 participants used the Gesture Watch in both mobile and stationary conditions as well as indoors and outdoors. Overall, we attained a recognition accuracy of 95.5{\%} and found that the Gesture Watch worked well in both indoor and outdoor environments and while mobile.},

@article{kim_ar_2010,
abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) has been acclaimed as one of the promising technologies for advancing future UbiComp (Ubiquitous Computing) environments. Despite a myriad of AR applications and its influence on the human–computer interaction field, end products that integrate AR are less commonplace than expected. This is due to a lack of being able to forecast in which direction mainstream standardization of AR-oriented platform components will be framed. It is mainly due to a focus on technology issues in implementing reasonable AR solutions, which also results in difficulty in initiating AR research and creating prototype test-beds. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive review of AR prototyping trends and AR research activities. Through the technical review of a de facto AR prototyping method, we remark upon the key elements of AR techniques, and then present an alternative view of the AR environment centered on end-user advantages in interaction, which is characterized by three features: intuitive observation, informative visualization, and immersive interaction. In addition, we believe that these features can be used to motivate the integration of AR technology into custom-built 3D applications. In this paper, we propose a conceptual schema and an architectural framework for generic AR prototyping. On the basis of these, a video see-through AR interface is integrated into three prototype 3D applications in 3 different domains: engineering systems, geospace, and multimedia. As the case studies for validating our integration, we present three sample AR applications; (a) an AR-interfaced 3D CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) simulation test-bed, (b) a two-stage distributed Traveler Guidance Service (TGS) test-bed based on a GIS database and AR, and (c) a haptically-enhanced broadcasting test-bed for AR-based 3D media production. For each application, a description of the test-bed implementation, demonstration of the feasibility and usefulness and AR-specific technical challenges are included in this paper.},

@article{kohlsdorf_magic_2013,
abstract = {Gestures for interfaces should be short, pleasing, intuitive, and easily recognized by a computer. However, it is a challenge for interface designers to create gestures easily distinguishable from users' normal movements. Our tool MAGIC Summoning addresses this problem. Given a specific platform and task, we gather a large database of unlabeled sensor data captured in the environments in which the system will be used (an "Everyday Gesture Library" or EGL). The EGL is quantized and indexed via multi-dimensional Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) to enable quick searching. MAGIC exploits the SAX representation of the EGL to suggest gestures with a low likelihood of false triggering. Suggested gestures are ordered according to brevity and simplicity, freeing the interface designer to focus on the user experience. Once a gesture is selected, MAGIC can output synthetic examples of the gesture to train a chosen classifier (for example, with a hidden Markov model). If the interface designer suggests his own gesture and provides several examples, MAGIC estimates how accurately that gesture can be recognized and estimates its false positive rate by comparing it against the natural movements in the EGL. We demonstrate MAGIC's effectiveness in gesture selection and helpfulness in creating accurate gesture recognizers.},

abstract = {Web applications have overcome traditional desktop appli-cations especially in collaborative settings. However, the bulk of Web applications still follow the " single user on a single device " computing model. Therefore, we created the DireWolf framework for rich Web appli-cations with distributed user interfaces (DUIs) over a federation of het-erogeneous commodity devices supporting modern Web browsers such as laptops, smart phones and tablet computers. The DUIs are based on wid-get technology coupled with cross-platform inter-widget communication and seamless session mobility. Inter-widget communication technologies connect the widgets and enable real-time collaborative applications as well as runtime migration in our framework. We show that the Dire-Wolf framework facilitates the use case of collaborative semantic video annotation. For a single user it provides more flexible control over dif-ferent parts of an application by enabling the simultaneous use of smart phones, tablets and computers. The work presented opens the way for creating distributed Web applications which can access device specific functionalities such as multi-touch, text input, etc. in a federated and usable manner.},

In this paper, we investigate the question whether gesturing with a mobile phone can help to perform complex tasks involving two devices. We present results from a user study, where we asked participants to spontaneously produce gestures with their phone to trigger a set of different activities. We investigated three conditions (device configurations): phone-to-phone, phone-to-tabletop, and phone to public display. We report on the kinds of gestures we observed as well as on feedback from the participants, and provide an initial assessment of which sensors might facilitate gesture recognition in a phone. The results suggest that phone gestures have the potential to be easily understood by end users and that certain device configurations and activities may be well suited for gesture control.},

We seek to guide UI design based on the tangential force applied by a user to the sur-face of a hand-held device. A prototype of an interface us-ing tangential force input was implemented utilizing a force sensitive layer and an elastic layer and used for the user experiment. We investigated user controllability to reach and maintain target force levels and considered the effects of hand pose and direction of force input. Our results imply no significant difference in performance when applying force holding the device in one hand and in two hands. We also observed that users have more physical and perceived loads when applying tangential force in the left-right direc-tion compared to the up-down direction. Based on the expe-rimental results, we discuss considerations for user interface applications of tangential-force-based interface.},

@inproceedings{lee_airtouch:_2011,
abstract = {We present the design and evaluation of Air Touch, a wristwatch interface that enables mobile gesture interaction through tactile feedback during limited visual attention conditions. Unlike its predecessor, the Gesture Watch, Air Touch is supported by a push-to-gesture mechanism (PTG) where the user performs a gesture and then confirms it afterward with a trigger gesture. The Gesture Watch, in contrast, requires the user to hold a trigger gesture while performing an interaction, and its PTG method does not allow the user to preview nor reverse the action. The effect of the new PTG mechanism and tactile feedback are evaluated through two experiments. The first experiment compares Air Touch's PTG mechanism to that of the Gesture Watch both with and without visual access to the watch. The second experiment examines mobile gesture interaction with the new PTG mechanism in four conditions (with and without tactile feedback and with and without visual restriction). We found that the new PTG mechanic enabled more accurate and faster interaction in the fully visible condition. Additionally, tactile feedback in the limited visual access condition successfully compensated for the lack of visual feedback, enabling similar performance times and perceived difficulties as in the fully visible condition without tactile feedback.},

Despite the increasing number of WWDs in the market, their limited dimensions and capabilities make their interaction design challenging. Designers struggle to downsize interactions originally designed for mobile phones, and end users wish for interactions that are easy to use. To better understand the users' concerns regarding the interaction with WWDs, we collected feedback about existing wearable bands, and analyzed the most critical issues currently faced in the interacting interaction with such devices. The analysis of the findings enabled us to derive 10 design recommendations that can aid to improve the interaction design in novel WWDs.},

abstract = {Medical imaging plays a central role in a vast range of healthcare practices. The usefulness of 3D visualizations has been demonstrated for many types of treatment planning. Nevertheless, full access to 3D renderings outside of the radiology department is still scarce even for many image-centric specialties. Our work stems from the hypothesis that this under-utilization is partly due to existing visualization systems not taking the prerequisites of this application domain fully into account. We have developed a medical visualization table intended to better fit the clinical reality. The overall design goals were two-fold: similarity to a real physical situation and a very low learning threshold. This paper describes the development of the visualization table with focus on key design decisions. The developed features include two novel interaction components for touch tables. A user study including five orthopedic surgeons demonstrates that the system is appropriate and useful for this application domain.},

Our work builds on these two primitives to allow the user to control how applications use segments alone and in coordination. Applications can expand to use more segments, collapses to encompass fewer, and be swapped with other segments.

We motivate the use of dual-purpose speech and explore issues of privacy and technological challenges related to mobile speech recognition. We present three applications that utilize dual-purpose speech to assist a user in conversational tasks: the Calendar Navigator Agent, DialogTabs, and Speech Courier. The Calendar Navigator Agent navigates a user's calendar based on socially appropriate speech used while scheduling appointments. DialogTabs allows a user to postpone cognitive processing of conversational material by proving short-term capture of transient information. Finally, Speech Courier allows asynchronous delivery of relevant conversational information to a third party.},

abstract = {Multi-touch displays represent a promising technology for the display and manipulation of 3D data. To fully exploit their capabilities, appropriate interaction techniques must be designed. In this paper, we explore the design of free 3D positioning techniques for multi-touch displays to exploit the additional degrees of freedom provided by this technology. Our contribution is two-fold: first we present an interaction technique to extend the standard four view-ports technique found in commercial CAD applications, and second we introduce a technique designed to allow free 3D positioning with a single view of the scene. The two techniques were evaluated in a preliminary experiment. The first results incline us to conclude that the two techniques are equivalent in term of performance showing that the Z-technique provides a real alternative to the statu quo viewport technique.},

- MM size independance is important 
- explicit delimiter is better for fine-tuning tasks

abstract = {With gesture-based interactions in mobile settings becoming more popular, there is a growing concern regarding the social acceptance of these interaction techniques. In this paper we begin by examining the various definitions of social acceptance that have been proposed in the literature to synthesize a definition that is based on how the user feels about performing a particular interaction as well as how the bystanders perceive the user during this interaction. We then present the main factors that influence gestures' social acceptance including culture, time, interaction type and the user's position on the innovation adoption curve. Through a user study we show that an important factor in determining social acceptance of gesture-based interaction techniques is the user's perception of others ability to interpret the potential effect of a manipulation.},

It is suggested that gestural commands tend to be terse, common, unambiguous, iconic, and similar to the spontaneous hand gestures that accompany speech. The potential effects of these five qualities are outlined by summarizing selected research from cognitive and social psychology. Some potential applications are also described.},

They contain a set of constraints that define what kind of actions or events are triggered in the applciation or GUI when its input events happen. Because of the componentized way in which they are designed, a single interactor can be associated with different types of widgets. In fact, a single Interactor can handle evnets in multiple graphical objects. finally, the interactors are designed to be independent from the input device and the graphics library used as well from the application.},

@inproceedings{nebeling_interactive_2014,
abstract = {Current GUI builders provide a design environment for user interfaces that target either a single type or fixed set of devices, and provide little support for scenarios in which the user interface, or parts of it, are distributed over multiple devices. Distributed user interfaces have received increasing attention over the past years. There are different, often model-based, approaches that focus on technical issues. This paper presents XDStudio--a new GUI builder designed to support interactive development of cross-device web interfaces. XDStudio implements two complementary authoring modes with a focus on the design process of distributed user interfaces. First, simulated authoring allows designing for a multi-device environment on a single device by simulating other target devices. Second, on-device authoring allows the design process itself to be distributed over multiple devices, as design and development take place on the target devices themselves. To support interactive development for multi-device environments, where not all devices may be present at design and run-time, XDStudio supports switching between the two authoring modes, as well as between design and use modes, as required. This paper focuses on the design of XDStudio, and evaluates its support for two distribution scenarios.},

abstract = { Several industrial and academic research groups are working to simplify the control of appliances and services by creating a truly universal remote control. Unlike the preprogrammed remote controls available today, these new controllers download a specification from the appliance or service and use it to automatically generate a remote control interface. This promises to be a useful approach because the specification can be made detailed enough to generate both speech and graphical interfaces. Unfortunately, generating good user interfaces can be difficult. Based on user studies and prototype implementations, this paper presents a set of requirements that we have found are needed for automatic interface generation systems to create high-quality user interfaces.},

@inproceedings{nichols_improving_2004,
abstract = {One of the challenges of using mobile devices for ubiquitous remote control is the creation of the user interface. If automatically generated designs are used, then they must be close in quality to hand-designed interfaces. Automatically generated interfaces can be dramatically improved if they use standard conventions to which users are accustomed, such as the arrangement of buttons on a telephone dial-pad or the conventional play, stop, and pause icons on a media player. Unfortunately, it can be difficult for a system to determine where to apply design conventions because each appliance may represent its functionality differently. Smart Templates is a technique that uses parameterized templates in the appliance model to specify when such conventions might be automatically applied in the user interface. Our templates easily adapt to existing appliance models, and interface generators on different platforms can apply appropriate design conventions using templates.},

@inproceedings{nichols_uniform:_2006,
abstract = {A problem with many of today's appliance interfaces is that they are inconsistent. For example, the procedure for setting the time on alarm clocks and VCRs differs, even among different models made by the same manufacturer. Finding particular functions can also be a challenge, because appliances often organize their features differently. This paper presents a system, called Uniform, which approaches this problem by automatically generating remote control interfaces that take into account previous interfaces that the user has seen during the generation process. Uniform is able to automatically identify similarities between different devices and users may specify additional similarities. The similarity information allows the interface generator to use the same type of controls for similar functions, place similar functions so that they can be found with the same navigation steps, and create interfaces that have a similar visual appearance.},

abstract = {When on the move, cognitive resources are reserved partly for passively monitoring and reacting to contexts and events, and partly for actively constructing them. The Re-source Competition Framework (RCF), building on the Multiple Resources Theory, explains how psychosocial tasks typical of mobile situations compete for cognitive resources and then suggests that this leads to the depletion of resources for task interaction and eventually results in the breakdown of fluent interaction. RCF predictions were tested in a semi-naturalistic field study measuring attention during the performance of assigned Web search tasks on mobile phone while moving through nine varied but typical urban situations. Notably, we discovered up to eight-fold differentials between micro-level measurements of atten-tional resource fragmentation, for example from spans of over 16 seconds in a laboratory condition dropping to bursts of just a few seconds in difficult mobile situations. By cali-brating perceptual sampling, reducing resources from tasks of secondary importance, and resisting the impulse to switch tasks before finalization, participants compensated for the resource depletion. The findings are compared to previous studies in office contexts. The work is valuable in many areas of HCI dealing with mobility.},

abstract = {The use of wearable technology will become significantly more prevalent in the coming years, with major companies releasing devices such as the Samsung Gear Fit. With sensors, such as pedometers and heart rate monitors, embedded in these devices it is possible to use them for fitness purposes. However, little is known about how wearable adopters actually use wearable and existing technologies during exercise. In an exploratory situated study of technology use and non-use in the context of the gym, fitness informatics adopters showed varied practices related to distraction, appropriating technology into their routines, and information needs. We discuss this variance in relation to individual differences and the impact of the physical nature of the gym. Although further research might show other influencing factors such as the social context, we make a case for the use of situated studies to uncover tensions that lead to use and non-use of technology that arise in the different unfolding situations of using wearables in everyday life, including at the gym, which is a surprisingly complex context.},

abstract = {We present WatchIt, a prototype device that extends interaction beyond the watch surface to the wristband, and two interaction techniques for command selection and execution. Because the small screen of wristwatch computers suffers from visual occlusion and the fat finger problem, we investigated the use of the wristband as an available interaction resource. Not only does WatchIt use a cheap, energy efficient and invisible technology, but it involves simple, basic gestures that allow good performance after little training, as suggested by the results of a pilot study. We propose a novel gesture technique and an adaptation of an existing menu technique suitable for wristband interaction. In a user study, we investigated their usage in eyes-free contexts, finding that they perform well. Finally, we present techniques where the bracelet is used in addition to the screen to provide precise continuous control over list scrolling. We also report on a preliminary survey of traditional and digital jewelry that points to the high frequency of watches and bracelets in both genders and gives a sense of the tasks people feel like performing on such devices.},

The proposed Pick-and-Drop allows a user to pick up an object on a display and drop it on another display as if he/she were manipulating a physical object. Even though the pen itself does not have storage capabilities, a combination of Pen-ID and the pen manager on the network provides the illusion that the pen can physically pick up and move a computer object. Based on this concept, we have built several experimental applications using palm-sized, desktop, and wall-sized pen computers. We also considered the importance of physical artifacts in designing user interfaces in a future computing environment.},

Both devices allow users to interact with wearable or nearby computers by using gesture-based commands. Both are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so they can be used under various social contexts. The first device, called GestureWrist, is a wristband-type input device that recognizes hand gestures and forearm movements. Unlike DataGloves or other hand gesture-input devices, all sensing elements are embedded in a normal wristband. The second device, called GesturePad, is a sensing module that can be attached on the inside of clothes, and users can interact with this module from the outside. It transforms conventional clothes into an interactive device without changing their appearance.},

abstract = {Computing environments which involve many interacting devices are a challenge for system and user interface designers. A prototype of a multiple-device application consisting of a personal digital assistant (PDA) that operates in conjunction with interactive television (ITV) was developed from user requirements for a real estate information service. The application is used both as a stand-alone service and in conjunction with a television. Users interact exclusively with the PDA. The television responds to PDA output and is used for the presentation of visual hnages and videos. In this paper the application is described and user interface design issues that arise in the context of multiple device systems are discussed.},

abstract = {We conducted an empirical investigation of wearable interactive rings on the noticeability of four instantaneous notification channels (light, vibration, sound, poke) and a channel with gradually increased temperature (thermal) during five levels of physical activity (laying down, sitting, standing, walking, and running). Results showed that vibration was the most reliable and fastest channel to convey notification, followed by poke and sound which shared similar noticeability. The noticeability of these three channels was not affected by the level of physical activity. The other two channels, light and thermal, were less noticeable and were affected by the level of physical activity. Our post-experimental survey indicates that while noticeability has a significant influence on user preference, each channel has its own unique advantages that make it suitable for different notification scenarios.},

abstract = {Modern smartphones contain sophisticated sensors to monitor three-dimensional movement of the device. These sensors permit devices to recognize motion gestures - deliberate movements of the device by end-users to invoke commands. However, little is known about best-practices in motion gesture design for the mobile computing paradigm. To address this issue, we present the results of a guessability study that elicits end-user motion gestures to invoke commands on a smartphone device. We demonstrate that consensus exists among our participants on parameters of movement and on mappings of motion gestures onto commands. We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set. We highlight the implications of this work to the design of smartphone applications and hardware. Finally, we argue that our results influence best practices in design for all gestural interfaces.},

abstract = {Natural forms of interaction have evolved for personal devices that we carry with us (mobiles) as well as for shared interactive displays around us (surfaces) but interaction across the two remains cumbersome in practice. We propose a novel cross-device interaction style for mobiles and surfaces that uses the mobile for tangible input on the surface in a stylus-like fashion. Building on the direct manipulation that we can perform on either device, it facilitates fluid and seamless interaction spanning across device boundaries. We provide a characterization of the combined interaction style in terms of input, output, and contextual attributes, and demonstrate its versatility by implementation of a range of novel interaction techniques for mobile devices on interactive surfaces.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel context sensitive system design paradigm. Multiple sensors/computational architecture, in the form of our eWatch device, is used to infer the activities that the system is encountering, and can provide a platform for context-aware computing. We created an eWatch prototype that senses user activities and notifies them when important messages have arrived. An accelerometer and microphone provide inputs to a model of interruptibility. A vibration motor for tactile feedback and two ultra bright LEDs for visual feedback provide user notification through different vibration patterns and colors. eWatch is transparently integrated into the user?s environment, and communicates via Bluetooth. This new class of integrated systems underscores the need for new forms of regularity, constraints, and design structure. Our results indicate the power of our method to accurately determine a meaningful context model while only requiring data from our eWatch device.},

abstract = {It is well documented that interacting with a mobile phone is associated with poorer performance on concurrently performed tasks because limited attentional resources must be shared between tasks. However, mobile phones generate auditory or tactile notifications to alert users of incoming calls and messages. Although these notifications are generally short in duration, they can prompt task-irrelevant thoughts, or mind wandering, which has been shown to damage task performance. We found that cellular phone notifications alone significantly disrupted performance on an attention-demanding task, even when participants did not directly interact with a mobile device during the task. The magnitude of observed distraction effects was comparable in magnitude to those seen when users actively used a mobile phone, either for voice calls or text messaging.

abstract = {Certain user interface functions require single- or few-character interactions and in some systems the number of functions which is made available exceeds the number of suitable key combinations. Hence modes are introduced; keys can be given different interpretations in different modes. But this is a source of user interface ambiguity; if there are too many frequently-used modes then the user can make errors all too easily. Definite user interface techniques, which are discussed, can be chosen to increase ease of use/user satisfaction: for instance, by reducing the number of necessary modes or the consequences of user typing errors. To make an interface consistent and predictable requires considerable effort, even if only at this level of single character semantics.},

abstract = {In pen-based interfaces, inking and gesturing are two central tasks, and switching from inking to gesturing is an important issue. Previous studies have focused on mode switching in pen-based desktop devices. However, because pen-based handheld devices are smaller and more mobile than pen-based desktop devices, the principles in mode switching techniques for pen-based desktop devices may not apply to pen-based handheld devices. In this paper, we investigated five techniques for switching between ink and gesture modes in two form factors of pen-based handheld devices respectively: PDA and Tablet PC. Two quantitative experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of these mode switching techniques. Results showed that in Tablet PC, pressure performed the fastest but resulted in the most errors. In PDA, back tapping offered the fastest performance. Although pressing and holding was significantly slower than the other techniques, it resulted in the fewest errors in Tablet PC and PDA. Pressing button on handheld device offered overall fast and accurate performance in Tablet PC and PDA.},

These devices present the user with a duality of visual worlds, with a virtual window of information overlaid onto the physical world. Because of this duality, we suggest that the wearable interface would benefit from understanding where the user's visual attention is directed. We explore the potential of eye tracking to address this problem, and describe four eye tracking techniques designed to provide data about where the user's attention is directed. We also propose some attention-aware user interface techniques demonstrating the potential of the eyes for wearable displays user interface management.},

abstract = {Two approaches to the study of movement planning were contrasted. Data on the drawing of complex two-dimensional trajectories were used to test whether the covariations of the kinematic and geometrical parameters of the movement formalized by the two-thirds power law and by the isochrony principle (P. Viviani {\&} R. Schneider, 1991) can be derived from the minimum-jerk model hypothesis (T. Flash {\&} N. Hogan, 1985). The convergence of the 2 approaches was satisfactory insofar as the relation between tangential velocity and curvature is concerned (two-thirds power law). Global isochrony could not be deduced from the optimal control hypothesis. Scaling of velocity within movement subunits can instead be derived from the minimum-jerk hypothesis. The implications vis-{\`{a}}-vis the issue of movement planning are discussed with an emphasis on the representation used by the motor control system for coding the intended trajectories.},

abstract = {The relation between figural and kimematic aspects of movement was studied in handwriting and drawing. It was found that, throughout the movement, the tangential velocity V is proportional to the radius of curvature r of the trajectory; V = kr, or, equivalently, that the angular velocity is constant: d??(t)/dt = k. However, the constant k generally takes several distinct values during the movement, the changes being abrupt. These changes suggest a clear segmentation of the movement into units of action which overlap but do not coincide with the figural units as defined by the discontinuities of the movement (cuspids, points of inflection). This organisational principle holds even when movements are mechanically constrained or are executed under strict visuo-motor guidance. Moreover, the segmentation of a given trajectory is invariant with respect to the total duration of the movement. A tentative interpretation of the principle is proposed which results from the assumption that the actual movement is produced as a continuous approximation to an intended movement, and that the well known relationship between movement speed and extent in rectilinear trajectories (Fitts' law) also applies to such continuous approximation.},

Today the Internet is carrying us through an era of widespread distributed computing towards the relationship of ubiquitous computing, characterized by deeply imbedding computation in the world.

@article{Yu2010,
abstract = {We present the design and evaluation of FI3D, a direct-touch data exploration technique for 3D visualization spaces. The exploration of three-dimensional data is core to many tasks and domains involving scientific visualizations. Thus, effective data navigation techniques are essential to enable comprehension, understanding, and analysis of the information space. While evidence exists that touch can provide higher-bandwidth input, somesthetic information that is valuable when interacting with virtual worlds, and awareness when working in collaboration, scientific data exploration in 3D poses unique challenges to the development of effective data manipulations. We present a technique that provides touch interaction with 3D scientific data spaces in 7 DOF. This interaction does not require the presence of dedicated objects to constrain the mapping, a design decision important for many scientific datasets such as particle simulations in astronomy or physics. We report on an evaluation that compares the technique to conventional mouse-based interaction. Our results show that touch interaction is competitive in interaction speed for translation and integrated interaction, is easy to learn and use, and is preferred for exploration and wayfinding tasks. To further explore the applicability of our basic technique for other types of scientific visualizations we present a second case study, adjusting the interaction to the illustrative visualization of fiber tracts of the brain and the manipulation of cutting planes in this context.},

@article{Zhai2012,
abstract = {The potential for using stroke gestures to enter, retrieve and select commands and text has been recently unleashed by the popularity of touchscreen devices. This monograph provides a state-of-the-art inte- grative review of a body of human-computer interaction research on stroke gestures. It begins with an analysis of the design dimensions of stroke gestures as an interaction medium. The analysis classifies gestures into analogue versus abstract gestures, gestures for com- mands versus for symbols, gestures with different orders of complexity, visual-spatial dependent and independent gestures, and finger versus stylus drawn gestures. Gesture interfaces such as the iOS interface, the Graffiti text entry method for Palm devices, marking menus, and the SHARK/ShapeWriter word-gesture keyboard, make different choices in this multi-dimensional design space. The main body of this work consists of reviewing and synthe- sizing some of the foundational studies in the literature on stroke gesture interaction, particularly those done by the authors in the last decade. The human performance factors covered include motor control complexity, visual and auditory feedback, and human memory capabil- ities in dealing with gestures. Based on these foundational studies this review presents a set of design principles for creating stroke gesture interfaces. These include making gestures analogous to physical effects or cultural conventions, keeping gestures simple and distinct, defining stroke gestures systematically, making them self-revealing, supporting appropriate levels of chunking, and facilitating progress from visually guided performance to recall-driven performance. The overall theme is on making learning gestures easier while designing for long-term efficiency. Important system implementation issues of stroke gesture interfaces such as gesture recognition algorithms and gesture design toolkits are also covered in this review. The monograph ends with a few call-to-action research topics.},
