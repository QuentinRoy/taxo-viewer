abstract = {Wearable near-eye displays pose interesting challenges for interface design. These devices present the user with a duality of visual worlds, with a virtual window of information overlaid onto the physical world. Because of this duality, we suggest that the wearable interface would benefit from understanding where the user's visual attention is directed. We explore the potential of eye tracking to address this problem, and describe four eye tracking techniques designed to provide data about where the user's attention is directed. We also propose some attention-aware user interface techniques demonstrating the potential of the eyes for wearable displays user interface management.},

abstract = {We conducted an empirical investigation of wearable interactive rings on the noticeability of four instantaneous notification channels (light, vibration, sound, poke) and a channel with gradually increased temperature (thermal) during five levels of physical activity (laying down, sitting, standing, walking, and running). Results showed that vibration was the most reliable and fastest channel to convey notification, followed by poke and sound which shared similar noticeability. The noticeability of these three channels was not affected by the level of physical activity. The other two channels, light and thermal, were less noticeable and were affected by the level of physical activity. Our post-experimental survey indicates that while noticeability has a significant influence on user preference, each channel has its own unique advantages that make it suitable for different notification scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce two input devices for wearable computers, called GestureWrist and GesturePad. Both devices allow users to interact with wearable or nearby computers by using gesture-based commands. Both are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so they can be used under various social contexts. The first device, called GestureWrist, is a wristband-type input device that recognizes hand gestures and forearm movements. Unlike DataGloves or other hand gesture-input devices, all sensing elements are embedded in a normal wristband. The second device, called GesturePad, is a sensing module that can be attached on the inside of clothes, and users can interact with this module from the outside. It transforms conventional clothes into an interactive device without changing their appearance.},

However, some may find the operation of a system that employs non-traditional on-body interactions uncomfortable to perform in a public setting, impacting how readily a new form of mobile technology may be received. Thus, it is important for interaction designers to take into consideration the implications of on-body gesture interactions when designing wearable interfaces. In this study, we explore the third-party perceptions of a user’s interactions with a wearable e-textile interface. This two-prong evaluation examines the societal perceptions of a user interacting with the textile interface at different on-body locations, as well as the observer’s attitudes toward on-body controller placement. We performed the study in the United States and South Korea to gain cultural insights into the perceptions of on-body technology usage.},

abstract = {The use of wearable technology will become significantly more prevalent in the coming years, with major companies releasing devices such as the Samsung Gear Fit. With sensors, such as pedometers and heart rate monitors, embedded in these devices it is possible to use them for fitness purposes. However, little is known about how wearable adopters actually use wearable and existing technologies during exercise. In an exploratory situated study of technology use and non-use in the context of the gym, fitness informatics adopters showed varied practices related to distraction, appropriating technology into their routines, and information needs. We discuss this variance in relation to individual differences and the impact of the physical nature of the gym. Although further research might show other influencing factors such as the social context, we make a case for the use of situated studies to uncover tensions that lead to use and non-use of technology that arise in the different unfolding situations of using wearables in everyday life, including at the gym, which is a surprisingly complex context.},

In this paper we begin by examining the various definitions of social acceptance that have been proposed in the literature to synthesize a definition that is based on how the user feels about performing a particular interaction as well as how the bystanders perceive the user during this interaction. We then present the main factors that influence gestures' social acceptance including culture, time, interaction type and the user's position on the innovation adoption curve. Through a user study we show that an important factor in determining social acceptance of gesture-based interaction techniques is the user's perception of others ability to interpret the potential effect of a manipulation.},

abstract = {Pervasive computing has postulated to invisibly integrate technology into everyday objects in such a way, that these objects turn into smart things. Not only a single object of this kind is supposed to represent the interface among the "physical world" of atoms and the "digital world" of bits, but a whole landscapes of them. The interaction with such technology rich artefacts is supposed to be guided by their affordance, i.e. the ability of an artefact to express the modality of its appropriate use. We study human gesticulation and the manipulation of graspable and movable everyday artefacts as a potentially effective means for the interaction with smart things. In this work we consider gestures in the general sense of a movement or a state (posture) of the human body, as well as a movement or state of any physical object resulting from human manipulation. Intuitive "everyday"-gestures have been collected in a series of user tests, yielding a catalogue of generic body and artefact gesture dynamics. Atomic gestures are described by trajectories of orientation data, while composite gestures are defined by a compositional gesture grammar. The respective mechanisms for the recognition of such gestures have been implemented in a general software framework supported by an accelerometer-based sensing system. Showcases involving multiple gesture sensors demonstrate the viability of implicit embedded interaction for real life scenarios.},

We describe a prototype device with infra-red (IR) proximity sensors embedded along each side and capable of detecting the presence and position of fingers in the adjacent regions. When this device is rested on a flat surface, such as a table or desk, the user can carry out single and multi-touch gestures using the space around the device. This gives a larger input space than would otherwise be possible which may be used in conjunction with or instead of on-display touch input. Following a detailed description of our prototype, we discuss some of the interactions it affords.},
